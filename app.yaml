# Handlers tell app engine how to route requests to your application.

# This handler tells app engine how to route requests to a WSGI application.

# Third party libraries that are included in the App Engine SDK must be listed

# of the App Engine SDK don't need to be listed here, instead add them to your
# project directory, either as a git submodule or as a plain subdirectory.
# Note that dependencies must be located in your project directory - packages
# installed in the Python environment are not loaded by the App Engine development
# server or deployment tools.
