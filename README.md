# Hummingbird Export

This app is developed in Python using Flask to allow [Hummingbird](http://hummingbird.me) users to download their viewing statistics as an XML file.

Experimental functionality has been added to create an xml file that is importable on [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net).

To run locally, populate the data in `hummingbirdexport/keys.py.template` and save it as `hummingbirdexport/keys.py`
